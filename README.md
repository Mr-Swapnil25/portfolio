# 3D Interactive  Portfolio

## 🌄 Overview

This project is a **cinematic, interactive portfolio** that showcases my journey in data science, AI tools, and intelligent agent systems. It blends technology, creativity, and functionality, offering visitors a unique, scroll-driven 3D experience. Inspired by modern 3D developer portfolios, this site is both a technical showcase and a personal narrative.

## ✨ Features

- **Cinematic Parallax Animation:** Multi-layered SVG scenes animated with GSAP and ScrollTrigger for immersive, smooth scrolling.
- **3D Visual Storytelling:** Each scene represents a chapter of my professional journey, using depth, light, and motion.
- **Dynamic Interactivity:** Responsive elements and cues encourage exploration and revisiting key moments.
- **Showcase of AI & Agent Systems:** Highlights my work with intelligent agents, machine learning, and data engineering.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Efficient SVG rendering, lazy loading, and scroll-based triggers for a seamless experience.
- **Customizable & Scalable:** Modular code structure for easy extension and adaptation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **SVG & HTML5:** For scalable, crisp vector graphics.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** Powers all animations and scroll-based effects.
- **GSAP ScrollTrigger:** Drives scene transitions and parallax effects.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Modular animation and interactivity logic.
